## 🔬 Featured Research Projects

These are my key contributions to the field of efficient LLM training.
<!--
### GROUTER: Preemptive Routing for Stable and Efficient Mixture-of-Experts Training
* **Core Problem:** Systematically identified and provided a theoretical analysis of **Structure-Performance Interference (SPI)**—the inherent instability and optimization error accumulation caused by dynamic routing decisions in MoE training.
* **Innovation:** Proposed **GROUTER**, the first preemptive routing framework designed to *eliminate* SPI. We employ **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** to extract a high-quality, stable routing prior from a well-converged source model, injecting it as a fixed, near-optimal router into the target model.
* **Methodology:** Engineered two novel, complementary strategies for structural migration: **Expert Folding** and **Expert Tuning**.
* **Impact & Results:** Accelerated pre-training data utilization by **4.28x** and achieved up to **33.5% training throughput acceleration**.
-->
### An Efficient Subspace Algorithm for Federated Learning on Heterogeneous Data
* **Core Problem:** Addressed the dual challenge in Federated Learning: severe communication bottlenecks and detrimental client drift caused by Non-IID data.
* **Innovation:** Developed **FedSub**, an efficient subspace federated optimization algorithm that fundamentally enhances communication efficiency and convergence stability.
* **Technical Breakthroughs:** Utilized low-dimensional projection for model update compression (O(md) $\to$ O(rd)) and introduced a **dual variable correction mechanism** to mitigate client drift.
* **Validation:** Achieved comparable convergence accuracy to full-dimension methods at a **50% compression rate**, demonstrating superior convergence speed over established baselines.
* **Implementation** The algorithm has been adapted within my FedSub repository. This repository not only details how to reproduce the main experiments but also includes a packaged implementation of the algorithm. You can refer to the Readme.md to learn how to apply the FedSub algorithm to your own training tasks.
